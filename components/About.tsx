            <p className="leading-snug">Hi! I'm Rushi, a DevOps Engineer, homelab enthusiast, and part-time software developer a full-fledged nerd. I primarily work with on-premises and cloud infrastructure, diving deep into systems and tools that enable scalable and efficient deployments.I also run a homelab where I host numerous services, providing a playground for experimenting with DevOps and SRE-related work. One of my ongoing projects, ConfigCloud, is a self-hosted VPS platform running on this homelab. When I'm not busy with office work, you'll most likely find me tinkering with infrastructure, writing code, or exploring new ideas in my homelab ;)
